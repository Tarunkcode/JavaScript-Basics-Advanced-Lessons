In the class, create a getter to obtain the temperature in Celsius and a setter to set the temperature in Celsius.

Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value of temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the value of the same temperature in Celsius.

Note: When you implement this, you will track the temperature inside the class in one scale, either Fahrenheit or Celsius.

This is the power of a getter and a setter. You are creating an API for another user, who can get the correct result regardless of which one you track.

In other words, you are abstracting implementation details from the user.

/*
Handle a Fulfilled Promise with then
Promises are most useful when you have a process that takes an unknown amount of time in your code (i.e. something asynchronous), often a server request. When you make a server request it takes some amount of time, and after it completes you usually want to do something with the response from the server. This can be achieved by using the then method. The then method is executed immediately after your promise is fulfilled with resolve. Hereâ€™s an example:

myPromise.then(result => {
  
});
*/
const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // responseFromServer is set to false to represent an unsuccessful response from a server
  let responseFromServer = false

  if (responseFromServer) {
    resolve("We got the data")
  } else {
    reject("Data not received")
  }
})

makeServerRequest.then(result => {
  console.log(result)
})
makeServerRequest.catch(error => {
  console.log(error)
})
